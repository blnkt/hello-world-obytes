# Pull Request: Phase 4 - Collection & Progression Systems

## Overview

This PR implements Phase 4 of the Delver's Descent feature, adding comprehensive collection and progression systems that provide long-term goals and permanent character advancement.

## Problem Solved

Players can complete runs and collect items, but lacked long-term progression goals and permanent character advancement. This phase adds collection sets with completion bonuses, region unlocks, and permanent progression integration to create meaningful advancement beyond individual runs.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Systems

- **Collection System**: Trade goods, regional discoveries, and legendary treasure sets
- **Bonus System**: Permanent bonuses for completed sets (energy efficiency, starting bonuses, abilities)
- **Region Unlock System**: New starting regions with unique encounter tables and themes
- **Permanent Progression**: Integration with existing character XP and level systems
- **Collection UI**: Comprehensive UI for viewing, tracking, and managing collections

### Key Features

#### Collection Management

- 12+ collection sets across 3 categories (Trade Goods, Discoveries, Legendaries)
- Automatic set completion detection
- Progress tracking across all runs
- Collection statistics (total items, sets completed, completion rate)

#### Permanent Bonuses

- Energy efficiency bonuses (+10% for trade goods completions)
- Starting energy bonuses (+20% for regional discovery completions)
- Region unlocks for legendary treasure completions
- Special abilities for completing multiple sets

#### Region System

- 5 starting regions with unique themes and encounter distributions
- Region-specific bonuses (energy, items)
- Unlock requirements based on collection completion
- Visual theming per region

#### UI Components

- CollectionOverview: Main collection management screen with progress tracking
- SetDetailView: Detailed view showing collected/missing items and bonuses
- RegionSelection: Region selection interface with unlock status

- Region unlock and selection flow
- Collection progress persistence across multiple runs
- Performance requirements validation
- Bonus balance testing

### Test Coverage

- All core functionality covered by integration tests
- API compatibility verified
- Performance requirements validated

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Required

No migration needed. New collection data is stored in new keys.

## Success Metrics

- Collection progress tracking across all runs
- Permanent bonuses enhance gameplay without trivializing difficulty
- Region unlocks provide meaningful progression goals
- Performance requirements met (lookups < 10ms, UI < 100ms)

## Next Steps
