### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `pnpm test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The enhancements will integrate with existing MMKV storage for achievements and statistics.
- Performance monitoring should be implemented to ensure 60fps gameplay is maintained.

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Requirements

- All animations must maintain 60fps performance
- Haptic feedback must not impact gameplay smoothness
- Navigation transitions must not cause frame drops
- Audio system must not significantly impact battery life

### Accessibility Standards

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guidelines
- Adhere to iOS and Android accessibility best practices
- Ensure compatibility with major screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Maintain color contrast ratios for all visual elements

### Integration Points

- Extend existing `useGameGridState` hook for accessibility features
- Integrate with existing MMKV storage for achievements and statistics
- Connect with current game state management in `DungeonGame` component
- Use existing React Native components and APIs where possible

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all enhancement functions with 100% coverage
- Integration tests for complete enhancement workflows
- Performance tests to ensure 60fps gameplay is maintained
- Accessibility tests for screen reader and gesture compatibility
- Cross-platform testing for iOS and Android functionality
- User experience testing with diverse user groups

### Dependencies

- React Native Reanimated 2 for smooth animations
- React Native Gesture Handler for touch controls
- React Native Haptic Feedback for haptic support
- Expo Router for navigation state management
- React Native Safe Area Context for screen space management
- Existing MMKV storage for achievements and statistics
