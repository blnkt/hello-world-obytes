# Product Requirements Document: Codebase Cleanup & Refactoring

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines a comprehensive cleanup and refactoring initiative for the hello-world-obytes codebase. The current codebase has accumulated technical debt, including dead code, unused dependencies, duplicate systems, type safety issues, and inconsistent error handling. This cleanup aims to improve code quality, maintainability, performance, and developer experience while establishing better practices for future development.

**Problem Statement**: The codebase contains significant technical debt that impacts development velocity, code quality, and maintainability. This includes demo components, unused dependencies, duplicate color systems, extensive use of `any` types, and inconsistent error handling patterns.

**Goal**: Transform the codebase into a clean, maintainable, and high-quality foundation that supports efficient development and provides an excellent developer experience.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Dead Code**: Remove all demo components, unused dependencies, and dead code paths
2. **Improve Type Safety**: Replace all `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces and types
3. **Consolidate Duplicate Systems**: Merge duplicate color systems and utility functions into single, consistent implementations
4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement a structured error logging and handling system
5. **Reduce Bundle Size**: Achieve measurable reduction in bundle size and build times
6. **Establish Clean Architecture**: Create clear patterns and standards for future development
7. **Improve Developer Experience**: Reduce confusion, improve IntelliSense, and establish better development practices
8. **Consolidate Test Mocks**: Centralize frequently used test mocks to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency

2. **Commit Strategy**: Use conventional commits with clear descriptions
3. **Testing**: Test each phase before moving to the next
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as changes are made

### **Quality Gates**

### **Mock Consolidation Guidelines**

1. **Mock File Structure**: All centralized mocks must be placed in `__mocks__/` directory
2. **Naming Convention**: Use kebab-case for mock file names (e.g., `dungeon-game-persistence.ts`)
3. **Export Pattern**: Export both individual functions and default object with all functions
4. **Type Safety**: All mocks must have proper TypeScript interfaces
5. **Helper Functions**: Include setup, teardown, and scenario helper functions
6. **Documentation**: Each mock file must include usage examples and common scenarios
7. **Test Updates**: All existing tests must be updated to use centralized mocks

8. **All Tests Pass**: No test failures introduced
9. **TypeScript Compilation**: No type errors
10. **ESLint Compliance**: No linting errors
11. **Performance Validation**: No performance regressions
12. **Code Review**: All changes reviewed by team members

### **Rollback Strategy**

1. **Phase-based Rollback**: Each phase can be rolled back independently

4. **Documentation**: Maintain rollback instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Create Feature Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/prd-codebase-cleanup
   ```

2. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with immediate cleanup of demo components and unused dependencies
