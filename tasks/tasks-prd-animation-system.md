### Notes

- All animations should use React Native Reanimated 3 for performance
- Animation components should be reusable and composable
- Tests should verify animation behavior, timing, and performance
- Use `pnpm test [path]` to run tests for specific components
- Maintain consistency with existing ScreenTransition component style
