# Tasks: Dungeon Game State Persistence

## Relevant Files

- `src/lib/storage/dungeon-game-persistence.ts` - Core persistence system for saving/loading dungeon game state
- `src/lib/storage/dungeon-game-persistence.test.ts` - Unit tests for the persistence system
- `src/components/dungeon-game/hooks/use-dungeon-game-persistence.tsx` - Custom hook for managing game persistence
- `src/components/dungeon-game/hooks/use-dungeon-game-persistence.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the persistence hook
- `src/components/dungeon-game/dungeon-game.tsx` - Main dungeon game component that needs persistence integration
- `src/components/dungeon-game/dungeon-game.test.tsx` - Integration tests for persistence functionality
- `src/components/dungeon-game/resume-choice-modal.tsx` - Modal component for choosing between resume/new game
- `src/components/dungeon-game/resume-choice-modal.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the resume choice modal
- `src/components/dungeon-game/hooks/use-game-grid-state.tsx` - Existing hook that needs persistence integration
- `src/components/dungeon-game/hooks/use-game-grid-state.test.tsx` - Updated tests for persistence integration
- `src/types/dungeon-game.ts` - Type definitions for game state and persistence data structures
- `src/types/dungeon-game.test.ts` - Type validation tests

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `pnpm test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The persistence system will integrate with the existing MMKV storage infrastructure used by `useCurrencySystem`.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Create Game State Persistence Infrastructure

  - [ ] 1.1 Create type definitions for game state persistence data structures
  - [ ] 1.2 Implement core persistence service with save/load operations
  - [ ] 1.3 Add data versioning and migration support for future compatibility
  - [ ] 1.4 Create data validation functions for save data integrity
  - [ ] 1.5 Add unit tests for persistence service with 100% coverage
  - [ ] 1.6 Integrate with existing MMKV storage infrastructure

- [ ] 2.0 Implement Real-Time Auto-Save System

  - [ ] 2.1 Create auto-save triggers for tile reveals and state changes
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement checkpoint saves for major game events (new game, level completion, game over)
  - [ ] 2.3 Add save status indicators and error handling for save operations
  - [ ] 2.4 Optimize save frequency to maintain 60fps gameplay performance
  - [ ] 2.5 Add unit tests for auto-save functionality
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement save data compression if needed for performance

- [ ] 3.0 Build Resume Choice System

  - [ ] 3.1 Create resume choice modal component with clean, non-intrusive design
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement logic to detect existing save data on game entry
  - [ ] 3.3 Add user choice handling between resume previous game or start fresh
  - [ ] 3.4 Create smooth transitions and animations for the modal
  - [ ] 3.5 Add unit tests for resume choice logic and modal behavior
  - [ ] 3.6 Integrate with navigation system for proper modal display

- [ ] 4.0 Integrate with Existing Game Components

  - [ ] 4.1 Update `useGameGridState` hook to integrate with persistence system
  - [ ] 4.2 Modify main `DungeonGame` component to use persistence hooks
  - [ ] 4.3 Add persistence state management to game state flow
  - [ ] 4.4 Integrate auto-save triggers with existing tile reveal and turn logic
  - [ ] 4.5 Update existing tests to work with persistence integration
  - [ ] 4.6 Ensure all existing functionality continues to work as expected

- [ ] 5.0 Add Error Handling & Data Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Implement corrupted data detection and graceful recovery
  - [ ] 5.2 Add storage failure handling with user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] 5.3 Create fallback behavior for when persistence operations fail
  - [ ] 5.4 Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring
  - [ ] 5.5 Implement data cleanup for abandoned or corrupted save files
  - [ ] 5.6 Add integration tests for error scenarios and edge cases

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Requirements

- Game state loading must complete within 2 seconds
- Real-time saves must not impact 60fps gameplay
- Save operations should add less than 500ms to game interactions

### Data Structure Considerations

- Save data should include version field for future compatibility
- Use JSON serialization for complex game state objects
- Implement incremental updates to minimize storage operations
- Consider data compression for larger save files

### Integration Points

- Extend existing `useCurrencySystem` storage infrastructure
- Integrate with `useGameGridState` hook for grid state persistence
- Connect with existing game state management in `DungeonGame` component
- Use existing MMKV storage for all persistence operations

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all persistence functions with 100% coverage
- Integration tests for complete save/load workflows
- Performance tests to ensure save operations meet timing requirements
- Error handling tests for corrupted data and storage failures
- Cross-platform testing for iOS and Android compatibility
