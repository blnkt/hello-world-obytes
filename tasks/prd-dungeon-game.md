# PRD: Dungeon Game Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Dungeon Game is a grid-based puzzle game where players navigate through a 6x5 grid of hidden tiles, revealing them one by one to find the exit while avoiding traps and collecting treasures. Each tile reveal costs 1 turn, and players must strategically manage their turn count to reach the exit before running out of turns. The turn system is directly tied to the app's fitness currency - each turn costs 100 steps, and players can only play if they can afford the turns.

**Problem Solved:** Provides an engaging, turn-based puzzle experience that challenges players' strategic thinking and risk assessment while integrating with the app's fitness tracking system.

**Goal:** Create an interactive dungeon exploration game with clear win/lose conditions, engaging tile mechanics, smooth user experience, and meaningful integration with the app's currency system.

## Goals

1. **Core Gameplay**: Implement a fully functional 6x5 grid-based dungeon game with turn management
2. **Tile System**: Create five distinct tile types (exit, trap, treasure, bonus reveal, neutral) with unique behaviors
3. **Game States**: Support active gameplay, win state, and game over state within a single screen
4. **User Experience**: Provide clear visual feedback, intuitive controls, and smooth state transitions
5. **Level Progression**: Support multiple dungeon levels with increasing difficulty
6. **Currency Integration**: Integrate turn system with app's fitness currency (100 steps = 1 turn)
7. **Turn Management**: Dynamically calculate and display available turns based on current currency

## User Stories

1. **As a player**, I want to see how many turns I can afford with my current currency so I can plan my strategy accordingly.
2. **As a player**, I want to see my current currency and turn cost clearly displayed so I understand the economic impact of playing.
3. **As a player**, I want to click on tiles to reveal them so I can explore the dungeon and find the exit.
4. **As a player**, I want to see immediate feedback when I reveal a trap so I know I've lost a turn and spent currency.
5. **As a player**, I want to see immediate feedback when I reveal a treasure so I know I've gained a free turn and saved currency.
6. **As a player**, I want to see the bonus reveal tile automatically reveal adjacent tiles so I can discover more of the dungeon efficiently.
7. **As a player**, I want to see a win modal when I find the exit so I can choose to continue to the next level or return to the main menu.
8. **As a player**, I want to see a game over modal when I run out of turns so I can return to the main menu and try again.
9. **As a player**, I want to see the current level number so I can track my progress through the dungeon.
10. **As a player**, I want to see my currency decrease in real-time as I spend turns so I understand the cost of my decisions.
11. **As a player**, I want to be prevented from starting a game if I can't afford at least 1 turn so I don't waste time on unwinnable scenarios.

## Design Considerations

**UI Components:**

- Use existing `Text`, `Button`, and `Modal` components from the UI library
- Create new `GameGrid` and `GridTile` components for the core game mechanics
- Implement `StatusBar` and `StatusMessage` components for game state display
- Design tile icons that are clear and visually distinct

**Visual Design:**

- Follow the existing design system with muted earth tones and subtle textures
- Ensure sufficient contrast between tile types for accessibility
- Use consistent spacing and typography from existing components
- Implement clear visual feedback for different tile states

**Layout:**

- Center the game grid on screen with appropriate margins
- Position status information above the grid
- Place action buttons below the grid
- Use modal overlays for win/game over states

## Technical Considerations

**Component Architecture:**

- `DungeonGameScreen` as the main container managing game state
- `GameGrid` as a controlled component receiving tile data and click handlers
- `GridTile` as a presentational component with props for type, state, and click handler
- `CurrencyDisplay` as a component showing current currency and available turns
- Custom hooks for game logic (turn management, tile effects, win conditions)

**State Management:**

- Use React state for game state (turns, revealed tiles, current level)
- Integrate with existing currency system using `useCurrencySystem()` hook
- Implement real-time currency updates as turns are spent
- Handle game state transitions through conditional rendering

**Currency Integration:**

- Connect to existing `useCurrencySystem()` hook for real-time currency data
- Calculate available turns: `Math.floor(currency / 100)`
- Update currency in real-time as turns are spent
- Prevent game start if insufficient currency (< 100 steps)

**Performance:**

- Optimize grid rendering for smooth interactions
- Minimize re-renders by using appropriate React patterns
- Consider memoization for grid tiles if performance becomes an issue
- Ensure currency updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders

**Icon System:**

- Extend the existing icon library with new tile-specific icons
- Ensure icons are scalable and maintain clarity at different sizes
- Use consistent icon styling that matches the existing design system

**Currency Mechanics:**

- **Turn Cost**: Each turn costs exactly 100 steps from the player's currency
- **Turn Calculation**: Available turns = `Math.floor(currentCurrency / 100)`
- **Real-time Updates**: Currency and turn count update immediately when turns are spent
- **Minimum Playability**: Game cannot start if player has less than 100 steps
- **Currency Display**: Show both current currency and available turns prominently
- **Economic Feedback**: Clear indication of currency spent per turn and remaining balance

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All tile types work correctly with proper effects
2. **User Experience**: Players can complete a full game session without confusion
3. **Performance**: Grid interactions respond within 100ms
4. **Accessibility**: Game state and tile information are clear to all users
5. **Code Quality**: Components are reusable and follow existing patterns
6. **Currency Integration**: Turn count accurately reflects current currency and updates in real-time
7. **Economic Balance**: Turn cost (100 steps) feels appropriate and motivates continued fitness tracking

## Open Questions

1. **Level Progression**: Should the next level increase in difficulty (more traps, fewer treasures)?
2. **Tile Distribution**: Are there any constraints on where the exit tile can be placed?
3. **Bonus Reveal Logic**: What happens if a bonus reveal tile has no unrevealed adjacent tiles?
4. **Game Balance**: Should the initial turn count scale with level number?
5. **Error Handling**: How should the system handle edge cases like invalid tile states?

## Implementation Notes

- Start with a single level implementation before adding level progression
- Use TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage for game logic
- Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript
- Follow existing project patterns for component structure and styling
- Integrate with existing navigation and routing systems
